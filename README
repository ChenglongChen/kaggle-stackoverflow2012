Code submission for Kaggle Stack Overflow challenge
Initial development was based on
http://fastml.com/predicting-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/

And some of the code is derived from there. The data extraction (data2vw.py)
was rewritten from scratch, integrating the two scripts from the above post.
